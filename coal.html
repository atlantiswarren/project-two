    <h1>Debating Coalâ€™s Future</h1>
    <h2>
      The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneaht the towering smokestacks
      of four coal-fired power plants. A Fifth plant has been proposed, the
      lastest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets electricity
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
      plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by uncertain
      economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of the plants to
      be abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court systems. One such
      coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is already surrounded
      by four coal-fired power plants. American Municipal Power has proposed
      building a new Meigs County coal plant, slated to begin construction late
      this year or in early 2010. The following information provides background
      to explain why coal plants are at the center of a national debate over
      energy production and consumption.
